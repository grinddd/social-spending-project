This project consists of two components. The first part involves gathering data from Eurostat, specifically regarding social spending as a percentage of GDP and children's enrollment in education. This data is organized, and missing information is replaced with the mean value. In the second part, seaborn is utilized to create a regression to examine the correlation between the two variables—social spending as a percentage of GDP and children's enrollment in education—along with some graphic visualizations.
